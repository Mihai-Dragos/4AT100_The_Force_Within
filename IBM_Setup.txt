1. Configure Rhapsody to Stop "Machine Noise"
Before you commit any files, you must stop Rhapsody from writing the "Current Time" and "My Computer Path" into the C/C++ files. If you don't do this, every time you generate code, the file header changes, creating merge conflicts.

a. Change these properties in your Rhapsody Project (under Project > Features):

	Disable Timestamps:

	Find: CG::Configuration::AddGenerationTime

	Set to: False

Why: This stops the "Generated on Mon Feb 19..." line from appearing in every file header.


b. Force Relative Paths:

	Find: General::Model::ReferenceUnitPath

	Set to: Relative

Why: This ensures the project doesn't look for C:\Users\YourName\Project but rather just ..\Project.


c. Clean File Headers (Optional but Recommended):

	Check CG::File::Header. If it contains macros like $Date or $Login, remove them.
