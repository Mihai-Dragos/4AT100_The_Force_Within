# --- 1. Ignore Build Artifacts (Binaries) ---
*.obj
*.o
*.exe
*.dll
*.lib
*.pdb
*.map

# --- 2. Ignore Generated Makefiles ---
# CRITICAL: Do not share the makefile. It contains absolute paths to your compiler.
# Rhapsody will regenerate this automatically when your friend hits "Build".
*.mak
*.mk
makefile

# --- 3. Manage the Generated Code Folder ---
# We generally want to track the code inside the _rpy folder, 
# but we want to ignore the junk inside it.

# Ignore the entire folder initially...
# *_rpy/

# ...BUT strictly un-ignore (allow) the source files inside it:
!*_rpy/*.c
!*_rpy/*.cpp
!*_rpy/*.h
!*_rpy/*.hpp
